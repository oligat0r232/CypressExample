# An example of Cypress

This is my example of setting up Cypress and using it to perform some basic tests on an automation practise website.

Cypress is more powerful when being used on a vue.js app but I am still learning vue.js and do not have an app built to test.

- install node.js
- run npm install
- run npx cypress open
